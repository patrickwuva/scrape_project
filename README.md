# Scrape Project
goals: 
- get all offenders off of the [nsopw](https://www.nsopw.gov/) website
- get images of each offender from their state's website
- store offender information in a database along with their images
- longer term goal, but set up a workflow to update the database every month or so

problems to deal with:
- there are probbaly ~ 750,000 offenders in America
- how do we scrape all offender data in a reasonable amount of time
- the website is not a fan of us spamming them
- how do we store all of the data we collect
